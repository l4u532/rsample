#' Rolling Origin Forecast Resampling
#'
#' This resampling method is useful when the data set has a strong time component. The resamples are not random and contain data points that are consecutive values. The function assumes that the original data set are sorted in time order.
#'
#' @details
#' The main options, `initial` and `assess`, control the number of data points from the original data that are in the analysis and assessment set, respectively. When `cumulative = TRUE`, the analysis set will grow as resampling continues while the assessment set size will always remain static.
#' `skip` enables the function to not use every data point in the resamples. When `skip = 0`, the resampling data sets will increment by one position. Suppose that the rows of a data set are consecutive days. Using `skip = 6` will make the analysis data set operate on *weeks* instead of days. The assessment set size is not affected by this option.
#' @inheritParams vfold_cv
#' @param initial The number of samples used for analysis/modeling in the initial resample.
#' @param assess The number of samples used for each assessment resample.
#' @param cumulative A logical. Should the analysis resample grow beyond the size specified by `initial` at each resample?.
#' @param skip A integer indicating how many (if any) resamples to skip to thin the total amount of data points in the analysis resample.
#' @export
#' @return  An tibble with classes `rolling_origin`, `rset`, `tbl_df`, `tbl`, and `data.frame`. The results include a column for the data split objects and a column called `id` that has a character string with the resample identifier.

#' # You can also roll over calendar periods by first nesting by that period,
#' # which is especially useful for irregular series where a fixed window
#' # is not useful. This example slides over 5 years at a time.
